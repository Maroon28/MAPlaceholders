## Available Placeholders

### Arena placeholders

Arena placeholders are used to retrieve info from a specific arena at any given time!

To use it, replace '{arena}' with the actual arena name! For example, `%mobarena_arena_default_state%` will return the state of the arena 'default'. You can also use `$current` as your arena name to get info for the current arena that the player is in! If the player isn't in said arena, it'll return an empty string.

## Player placeholders

These placeholders are used to get info from a player's current arena stats. So the kills they've made in the current session, swings, hits, and so on. If the player is not in an arena, the placeholders output an empty string (""). Once a player dies, all these stats are cleared. If you're looking for permanent stats, scroll further!
